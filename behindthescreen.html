            RESULT
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            The title “behind the screen” appears with glitching effect, which gives not only the feeling of cyberspace but also reminds people of negative things about technology, including cyberbullying. In the middle of the screen is a hand raising asking for help to get away from the danger of technology for users to click on to explore further. <br>
            The chat box takes audiences through the story of a character, a victim of cyberbullying, for them to understand and empathise. <br>
            The illustrations include the combination of technological devices with weapons and things to indicate death, which alludes to the danger of technology, with cyberbullying being a part of it, for example, the knife coming out of the computer, a hand asking for help from the smartphone, being depressed and suiciding because of social media, and the computer mouse connects with a rope also indicate suicide. <br>
            The blue background gets lighter on scrolling down to show the aim also the hope with making the problem of only bullying get better. <br>
