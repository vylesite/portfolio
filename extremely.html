            PROCESS
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            For this collaborative project, I worked as a part of the web design/development team as an front-end developer. Our team's responsibility was to design the UX/UI and develop the holding page to promote the online event, as well as the website, one of the most important for of the event, to feature every work that all the teams of the project worked on, as well as display every selected artwork for the exhibition.

        </div>

        <div class="text">
            In both stages of our team’s work, building the holding page and the website for extremely online, I took the responsibility of turning the wireframe that we received from the UX/UI designers into code, building up the structure of the holding page and the event website. With my skills in coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created the first iteration of the holding page and the webpage for the whole team to collaborate and develop further for the final version of them. I took part in working on the responsiveness and compatibility of the website as well.
